// 11. FAQ Items
export const FAQ_ITEMS: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    id: "01",
    question: `How does ${COMPANY_NAME} ensure natural, undetectable hair transplant results?`,
    answer: `At ${COMPANY_NAME}, our surgeons handcraft every hairline considering your facial bone structure, age, and natural hair exit angles. We selectively implant single-hair follicles along the front perimeter with gradual micro-irregularities to replicate organic hair growth.`,
  },
  {
    id: "02",
    question: "Is a hair transplant procedure truly permanent?",
    answer: "Yes. Transplanted follicles are harvested from the DHT-resistant safe donor zone at the back and sides of your scalp. These roots maintain their genetic resistance to balding hormones and continue to grow naturally for life.",
  },
  {
    id: "03",
    question: `What makes ${COMPANY_NAME} techniques different from standard clinics?`,
    answer: `Unlike commercial setups where non-medical staff perform surgeries, ${COMPANY_NAME} procedures are surgeon-led in sterile surgical theaters. Our micro-extraction and direct implanter pen methods minimize out-of-body graft time, ensuring 95%+ follicle viability.`,
  },
  {
    id: "04",
    question: "Can an unnatural or failed previous transplant be corrected?",
    answer: `Yes. We frequently perform corrective and revision surgeries to fix pluggy hairlines, unnatural angles, and donor scarring from previous low-cost procedures through meticulous follicle redistribution and scar camouflage.`,
  },
  {
    id: "05",
    question: "What is the recovery and growth timeline?",
    answer: "Most patients return to routine activities within 5 to 7 days. Micro-crusts shed by day 10. Transplanted hair begins steady new growth by month 3–4, with full natural density visible between 9 to 12 months.",
